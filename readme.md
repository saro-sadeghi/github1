# Audio Encryption in Python

This project demonstrates how to encrypt and decrypt audio files using the AES encryption algorithm in Python. The main goal is to ensure the security of audio data during transmission or storage.

## Features

- Encrypt audio files to prevent unauthorized access
- Decrypt encrypted audio files to retrieve the original audio
- Save encryption keys securely in a separate file
- Handle WAV audio format

## Requirements

- Python 3.x
- `pydub` library for handling audio files
- `cryptography` library for encryption and decryption
- `numpy` library (optional for additional functionalities)

## Installation

Install the required libraries using pip:

```sh
pip install pydub cryptography numpy
